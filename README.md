# ArtGenerator
 **A module to create random and almost certainly unique artworks!**
 
After seeing dozens of artificial intelligence projects to create artworks, I thought it would be cool to try something different. Instead of using a learning model, I wanted to develop something that could create artworks without any previous experience. This module is the result that I managed to achieve in a few days of vacation, mainly playing with playing with Pillow libary and using concepts of probability and geometry. 
 
 
 Anyway, I liked the end result, so I thought it was worth working on a detailed docstring and making the code available, in case anyone else finds it interesting
